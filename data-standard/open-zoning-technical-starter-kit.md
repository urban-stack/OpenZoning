# Open Zoning Technical Starter Kit

#### Open Zoning's record of all zoning constraints in Minneapolis (w/ code links) that it is aware of that exist in Minneapolis and restrict residential development

* \[Airtable page] ["full constraint list w/ meta-data](https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invIE9Rq8BJxoRZe9\&inviteToken=c24d20d82c00f933e02ca4d7f9b78088b2eaefcef049f3691df85eb48f858fbc\&utm\_medium=email\&utm\_source=product\_team\&utm\_content=transactional-alerts)

#### The master list (in human language) of all information captured by our schemas. As of 4/26/24, these schemas have not been created. The tables that comprise our master list need to be translated into schemas.

* \[Gitbooks page] "[OZFS Files and File Schemas, explained in detail](the-open-zoning-feed-specification-explained/ozfs-files-and-file-schemas-explained-in-detail.md)"

#### Spreadsheets capturing the accounting work for:&#x20;

1. the zoning constraints we currently capture in our district files **VS** the zoning constraints that we know exist in Minneapolis (as recorded in the Airtable referenced above)
2. the zoning constraints that our Engines process

    * this page contains the properties and sub-properties that we use within the district files to categorize zoning constraints. All properties and sub-properties are direct encoding of the way the Minneapolis Zoning Code&#x20;
