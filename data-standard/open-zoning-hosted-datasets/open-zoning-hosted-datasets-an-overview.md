# ðŸ“‚ Open Zoning-hosted datasets, an overview

Open Zoning hosts two overarching types of zoning data:

* **Municipality Feeds**, which are zoning codes transcribed directly into machine-readable form. This information is regulated by the Open Zoning Feed Specification and is openly contributed to by anyone.
* **Parcel-resolved zoning information**, which is zoning information that has been read from Municipality Feeds and has been resolved for each parcel according to the unique district combination that they are in. This is a dataset made possible and created by the Open Zoning "Engines" and is not openly contributable to. However, the code for the "Engines" are open source and links to them can be found in the "Our Backend Processing Engines" section.
